# Movie Editor Storyboard Generation Debugging

## Issue Summary
The storyboard generation feature is not working correctly. When attempting to generate a storyboard, the backend is erroneously mixing the SVG generation code paths with the storyboard JSON generation, causing issues where SVG content is being returned instead of JSON.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Architectural Problem**: Storyboard generation was reusing code paths designed for SVG generation
2. **Wrong Service Usage**: The AIService was used for both SVG generation and JSON storyboard generation
3. **Context Confusion**: The LLM is confused by mixed usage of prompt formats and keeps defaulting to SVG generation
4. **Shared Error Handling**: The error handling and validation for JSON and SVG responses were mixed
5. **Incomplete Separation**: Despite previous fixes, the two flows (storyboard and SVG generation) were not properly isolated

## Fix Steps

### Step 1: Create Dedicated Storyboard Service ✅
- Created a completely new `StoryboardService` module
- Implemented dedicated methods for generating storyboards with different AI providers
- Added proper validation specific to storyboard format requirements
- No reuse of any SVG-related code or utilities

### Step 2: Replace Movie Controller Implementation ✅
- Completely replaced the `generateStoryboard` controller implementation
- Now uses the dedicated StoryboardService instead of AIService
- Removed all the SVG-specific validation and processing code
- Simplified error handling with clean separation of concerns

### Step 3: Clarify Separate API Flows ✅
- Storyboard generation now uses a completely separate code path from SVG generation
- JSON storyboard generation has its own dedicated prompt formats
- Error handling is specific to storyboard generation
- No shared utilities between SVG and storyboard generation

### Step 4: Testing the Changes
- Test storyboard generation with the new implementation
- Verify that proper JSON storyboards are returned without SVG content
- Confirm that clips are generated correctly when using the storyboard with the animation service
- Test error cases to ensure proper error messages are displayed

## Benefits of the New Approach
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Different features now use different code paths
2. **Simplified Code**: Each service handles one specific type of content generation
3. **Better Error Handling**: Errors are specific to the feature context
4. **Clearer LLM Prompts**: Each feature has dedicated prompts without context confusion
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one feature don't affect the other

## Next Steps
- Monitor the performance of the storyboard generation
- Consider implementing a dedicated Claude storyboard generator
- Add more robust logging for debugging
- Consider adding feature flags to enable/disable features during testing
